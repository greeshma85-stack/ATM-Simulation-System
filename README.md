# ATM Simulation System (Java)

A **console-based ATM simulation application** built using **Java**, demonstrating core programming concepts such as **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), control flow, loops, and user input handling**.

This project simulates basic ATM functionalities like depositing money, withdrawing money, and checking account balance.

---

## Features

-  Deposit money into the account  
-  Withdraw money with balance validation  
-  View current account balance  
-  Menu-driven interface  
-  Encapsulation for secure balance handling  

---

## Technologies Used

- **Language:** Java  
- **Concepts Used:**  
  - Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)  
  - Classes and Objects  
  - Encapsulation  
  - Conditional Statements  
  - Loops  
- **Utilities:** Scanner (for user input)

##  How to Run the Program

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/greeshma85-stack/ATM-Simulation.git
   
2.Navigate to the project directory:
cd ATM-Simulation

3.Compile the program:
javac Main.java

4.Run the program:
java Main

---

## Key Concepts Demonstrated
Encapsulation: Account balance is private and accessed only through methods
Menu-driven logic: Implemented using switch-case
Input validation: Prevents withdrawal when balance is insufficient
Loop control: Program exits safely using System.exit(0)

---

## **Program Flow
User is shown ATM menu options
User selects an operation
Program performs the selected action
Menu repeats until the user chooses Exit**



## Sample Output
1.Deposite
2.Withdraw
3.Show Balance
4.Exit

Enter the choice: 1
Enter the amount to be deposited:
5000
Amount added successfully

## Future Enhancements

Add PIN authentication
Store transaction history
Integrate with a database (MySQL)
Convert to GUI-based application
